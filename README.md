# moto-11

A modular **ESP32 smart-cockpit, accessory, and security system** for a 2013 Suzuki
V-Strom DL650 — hardware, firmware, harness, and documentation in one repository.

The guiding philosophy is **"fairings off once"**: provision generously now, upgrade in
place later. The ESP32 owns all bike logic; a tablet is a thin display; the phone handles
navigation and connectivity.

---

## What it is

`moto-11` turns the bike into a programmable platform without making any consumer device a
single point of failure:

- **Bike-side controller** — an ESP32-WROOM-32D that is always-hot, deep-sleeps when parked,
  and wakes on ignition. It is the single source of truth for relay control, sensing,
  load management, security, and the parked sentinel.
- **Dashboard** — an Android tablet acting as a *thin* BLE display and an Android Auto
  receiver. UI only; it never decides anything.
- **Phone** — navigation, connectivity, and the BLE relay that drains the bike's event queue
  when it's parked out of network range.

It also folds in the unglamorous-but-important electrical work: a series R/R charging upgrade,
relieving the notorious headlight-through-the-starter-switch wiring, accessory switching via a
relay box driven by a ULN2803, and battery/charging telemetry from an INA226.

## Status

**Early development.** OTA firmware (WiFi + ArduinoOTA + heartbeat) is proven on the bench
across both ESP units. Relay control is now in: a `RelayController` drives the four ULN2803
coil enables (fail-OFF at boot) and a serial/Telnet **bench console** actuates them by hand
(`status`, `on/off`, `toggle`, `selftest`) for pre-install testing. Next firmware milestone:
INA226 bus-voltage + ignition-sense, then the autonomous engine-run supervisor
(SLEEP/ARMED/RUNNING/OFF_DELAY). Hardware is at the bench-prototyping stage. See `docs/adr/`
for the decisions made so far.

## Architecture

```

        └──────┬───────┘                       ▲ projects

  │ relay box   master relay     │        │ nav + relay │
  └──────────────────────────────┘        └─────────────┘
```

The ESP runs the bike; the tablet renders; the phone connects. A tablet reboot or removal
degrades only the UI, never the bike's function. Full reasoning is in
[`docs/adr/0001`](docs/adr/0001-esp32-authoritative-controller.md).

## Getting started (firmware)

### Prerequisites
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the **PlatformIO IDE** extension
- **Silicon Labs CP210x USB-to-UART driver** (the ESP boards use a CP2102 — without it Windows
  shows no COM port)
- Git

### Clone and open
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/moto-11.git
```
Open the **`firmware/`** subfolder in VS Code (`File → Open Folder → moto-11/firmware`).
PlatformIO expects `platformio.ini` at the root of the opened folder, so open `firmware/`
directly — not the repo root. (Git still tracks the whole repo.) On the first build,
PlatformIO downloads the ESP32 toolchain and framework; let it finish.

### Configure secrets
Copy the template and fill it in — it is gitignored, so your credentials never reach the repo:
```bash
cp include/secrets.h.example include/secrets.h
```
Set `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASS`, and an `OTA_PASS`. The `OTA_PASS` must match the `--auth=` value
in `platformio.ini`. Avoid `%` and `$` in the OTA password (the config parser treats them
specially).

### Build, flash, monitor
One codebase builds two devices via separate environments (`bench` / `bike`), distinguished by
`DEVICE_NAME`. First flash of each device is over USB:
```bash
pio run -e bench                 # build
pio run -e bench -t upload       # flash over USB
pio device monitor               # serial logs @ 115200
```
Swap `bench` → `bike` for the second unit. (In VS Code, the PlatformIO **Project Tasks** panel
exposes Build / Upload / Monitor per environment — use those rather than the status-bar buttons,
which act on whatever environment is selected.)

### OTA updates
After the first USB flash, update wirelessly:
```bash
pio run -e bench_ota -t upload
```
Set the device's IP (from the serial log) as `upload_port` in the `*_ota` environment if the
`.local` mDNS name doesn't resolve on your OS.

### Windows OTA gotcha
ArduinoOTA needs the ESP to open a connection *back* to your PC. Two things block this on
Windows:
- **Extra network adapters** (WSL/Hyper-V `vEthernet`, VMware, VirtualBox, VPN) — espota can
  advertise the wrong host IP. Disable them so only your real LAN/Wi-Fi adapter is active.
- **A third-party antivirus firewall** — independent of the Windows firewall; pause its network
  shield for the push.

Symptom is `Authenticating…OK` followed by `Waiting for device… No response`. See
[`docs/adr/0008`](docs/adr/0008-ota-ab-rollback.md).

## Documentation

- **[Bench relay guide](https://mixajlo.github.io/moto-11/bench-relay-guide.html)** —
  step-by-step: flash the firmware and click the relays on the bench (just an ESP + USB to
  start). Good first hands-on walkthrough. (Source: `docs/bench-relay-guide.html`.)
- **Design docs** — published via **GitHub Pages** from `/docs`:
  [home](https://mixajlo.github.io/moto-11/),
  [electrical plan](https://mixajlo.github.io/moto-11/electrical-plan.html),
  [wiring schematic](https://mixajlo.github.io/moto-11/wiring-schematic.html).
- **Decision records** (`docs/adr/`) — the *why* behind every major choice, Nygard-format.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — the condensed project brief; also what Claude Code reads on startup.

## Design principles

- **Colourblind-safe output, always.** Every diagram, chart, and UI uses the Okabe-Ito palette
  and never encodes meaning by colour alone — colour is always paired with line pattern and a
  text label. The maintainer is colourblind; this is a hard constraint.
- **Fail-safe by direction.** Accessories fail **OFF** (safe when the ESP dies); headlights fail
  **ON**. Safety-critical lighting is never solely behind the controller.
- **Bench-twin-first.** Every change is proven on the bench twin before it reaches the bike.
